## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is running your application stack on other peoples computers. That's it. Thanks for reading my post. If you wanted a more detailed description, cloud computing is the availability of on-demand resources to be provisioned without active management of the hardware running those resources. Think a computer where you only have to interact with the software, not the hardware.

## Where is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is anywhere you are not. That is the beauty.  The big three players in the game are Amazon Web Service (AWS),  Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. All three and many more have data centers across multiple continents ensuring low-latency access to their services. With their data centers all around the globe, in the event of an outage, the service can transition to another data center to prevent extended downtimes.

## Why is Cloud Computing?

1. **Cost reduction**:  Cloud computing eliminates the upfront investment of the hardware to host your application. Most common model for using cloud services is pay-as-you-go, ensuring you are only paying for what you need and nothing more.
2. **Reliability:** Redundancy from cloud providers cannot be matched by on-prem solutions for your application. Ensuring high availability and providing disaster recovery.
3. **Scalability:** Cloud services can be spun up and scaled quickly to meet business demands and changing workloads.

## Conclusion

Understanding the "what", "where", and "why" of cloud computing will give you the foundational view of it's significance in todays digital landscape. From personal use to corporation level workloads, it is an essential part of experience the web as we know it today.
